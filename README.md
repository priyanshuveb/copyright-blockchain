Smart contract to buy copyrights of a song from a big label to be able to make cover of it on the youtube platform.

So there exists a problem that the music artists cannot cover a song of a big label, as soon as they upload it is identified by youtube's contentid algorithm and is flagged. The next thing is either the video of cover song will be taken down or it will be monetized as per the instructions of the record label. Monetize meaning the earnings from this cover video won't be received by the user(the creator) but rather will be trasferred to the label. This is a smart contract which allows a user to buy copyrights of a song legally. The copyright fee is set by label accordingly. Since it is blockchain the list of users who bought the copyrights will be public and the label or any big company won't be able to double cross the user. This publically available list will be shared by label with the youtube. Youtube is responsible for distributing the earnings in the first place so it will transfer the percentage of total earnings of the video as decided per the contract. let's say if 100 USD are earned, 50 USD will go to the content creator and 50 will go to the label.
